 <h3> How to Set Up Chat-bot ?</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Register a Bot with BothFather</li> 
      <ol>
        <li>Open your Telegram app and search for "BotFather."</li>
        <li>Start a chat with BotFather.</li>
            Use the <code>/newbot</code> command to create a new bot.
        <li>Follow the instructions provided by BotFather, including choosing a name and
            username for your bot.</li>
        <li>Once your bot is created, BotFather will provide you with a unique API token. This
            token is required to interact with the Telegram Bot API and send and receive  
            messages with your bot.</li>
        <li>Copy the API token </li>
            <p>The API token is a long string of characters provided by BotFather. It serves as your
                bot's authentication key when communicating with Telegram's servers. You will need to
                keep this token secure and use it in your chatbot's code to send and receive messages.</p>
    </ol>
    <li>Setting Up MongoDB With Docker</li> 
<p>MongoDB is a NoSQL database system that is well-suited for e-commerce applications.
   It allows you to store and manage a wide variety of data, including product information,
   user profiles, order history, and more. Using Docker to set up MongoDB provides an
   efficient and portable way to manage your database environment.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Install Docker:</strong> If you haven't already, install Docker on your server or local
      machine. You can find installation instructions for your specific operating system on
      the Docker website.</li>
  <li><strong>Pull the MongoDB Docker Image:</strong> Open your terminal and run the following
      command to pull the official MongoDB Docker image:</li>
      <pre><code>docker pull mongo</code></pre>
  <li><strong>Run MongoDB in a Docker Container:</strong> Start a MongoDB container by running the
      following command:</li>
      <pre><code>docker run -d -p 27017:27017 --name my-mongodb mongo</code></pre>
      <p>Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the command:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>-d</code> runs the container in the background.</li>
        <li><code>-p 27017:27017</code> maps port 27017 from the container to the host machine, allowing
            you to access MongoDB locally.</li>
        <li><code>--name my-mongodb</code> assigns a name to your container.</li>
        <li><code>mongo</code> specifies the name of the Docker image.</li>
      </ul>
  <li><strong>MongoDB Connection:</strong> In your chatbot code, you can now connect to MongoDB
      using the host <code>localhost</code> and port <code>27017</code>. You can also specify a
      database name to store your e-commerce data.</li>
</ol>
